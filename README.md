WPF Framework is a free and open-source .NET 10.0 application framework for building desktop project management applications, developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Risk Management Center ([USACE-RMC](https://www.rmc.usace.army.mil/)). It provides a complete application shell with docking layout, project explorer, theme switching, undo/redo, and specialized controls for charting, databases, expression parsing, and directed acyclic graphs.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is under active development. Expect ongoing bug fixes and minor enhancements as the framework is prepared for broader public use.

## Supported Frameworks

| Platform | Version |
|----------|---------|
| .NET | 10.0 |
| OS | Windows 10+ |

WPF Framework can be consumed from source project references or packaged into NuGet bundles with `scripts/pack-wpf-framework.ps1`. The package layout follows the internal dependency map: Core, Models, Support, then Controls.

The framework depends on [RMC.Numerics](https://github.com/USACE-RMC/Numerics) through central NuGet package management in `Directory.Packages.props`. Source builds restore RMC.Numerics 2.1.4; NuGet bundles declare compatibility with RMC.Numerics 2.1.4 or later, below 3.0.0.

## Solution Structure

| Folder | Projects | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Core** | FrameworkInterfaces, Themes | Core contracts and theming engine |
| **Controls** | FrameworkUI, GenericControls, NumericControls, OxyPlotControls, DatabaseControls, ExpressionParserControls, DAGControls, Xceed.Wpf.AvalonDock, Xceed.Wpf.AvalonDock.Themes.VS2013 | Application shell, reusable WPF controls, and docking UI |
| **Models** | DatabaseManager, ExpressionParser, OxyPlot, OxyPlot.Wpf, OxyPlot.Wpf.Shared, DAG | Platform-agnostic model and engine libraries |
| **Support** | SoftwareUpdate, SoftwareUpdate.Updater | GitHub Releases-based auto-update system |
| **Demos** | FrameworkUI.Demo, GenericControls.Demo, NumericControls.Demo, OxyPlotControls.Demo, DatabaseControls.Demo, ExpressionParserControls.Demo, DAG.Demo | Interactive demo applications |
| **Tests** | OxyPlot.ExampleLibrary + 13 test projects | Example chart models and xunit, MSTest, and NUnit test suites |
| **Packaging** | RMC.Wpf.Framework.Core, RMC.Wpf.Framework.Models, RMC.Wpf.Framework.Support, RMC.Wpf.Framework.Controls | NuGet bundle projects |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Visual Studio 2022 (17.12 or later)
- Windows 10 or later

### Build and Test

```bash
dotnet build WPF-Framework.sln
dotnet test WPF-Framework.sln
```

### Build Packages

```bash
.\scripts\pack-wpf-framework.ps1 -Configuration Release -Version 1.0.4
```

This creates and validates the following NuGet packages in `artifacts/packages/`:

| Package | Includes | Depends on |
|---------|----------|------------|
| [`RMC.Wpf.Framework.Core`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RMC.Wpf.Framework.Core/) | FrameworkInterfaces, Themes | None |
| [`RMC.Wpf.Framework.Models`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RMC.Wpf.Framework.Models/) | DAG, DatabaseManager, ExpressionParser, OxyPlot libraries | ClosedXML, DocumentFormat.OpenXml, ExcelNumberFormat, FastMember, SourceGear.sqlite3, System.Data.SQLite |
| [`RMC.Wpf.Framework.Support`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RMC.Wpf.Framework.Support/) | SoftwareUpdate and updater content files | None |
| [`RMC.Wpf.Framework.Controls`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RMC.Wpf.Framework.Controls/) | FrameworkUI, control libraries, AvalonDock fork | Core, Models, Support, RMC.Numerics 2.1.4+ |

### Minimal Application

```csharp
// In App.xaml.cs — initialize theme before creating any UI
FrameworkUI.ThemeManager.SetTheme(FrameworkUI.ThemeColor.Light);

// Create project and controller
var project = new MyProject();
var controller = new MyProjectController(project);

// Show the main window
var mainWindow = new FrameworkUI.MainWindow();
mainWindow.ProjectNode = controller;
mainWindow.Show();
```

Run `FrameworkUI.Demo` for a complete working example.

## Key Features

### Theme Switching

Three built-in themes with runtime switching — all controls update automatically via `DynamicResource` bindings:

```csharp
FrameworkUI.ThemeManager.SetTheme(FrameworkUI.ThemeColor.Dark);
```

### Undo/Redo

Built-in undo/redo for element properties with automatic change tracking:

```csharp
public string CustomValue
{
    get => _customValue;
    set
    {
        if (_customValue != value)
        {
            var oldValue = _customValue;
            _customValue = value;
            RecordPropertyChange(nameof(CustomValue), oldValue, value);
        }
    }
}
```

### Docking Layout

VS2013-style docking with tabbed documents, auto-hide panels, and floating windows powered by a vendored AvalonDock fork.

### Charting

Vendored OxyPlot fork with a full toolbar (pan, zoom, annotation, export), property editors, theme integration, and XML serialization.

### Database Management

Multi-format database abstraction supporting SQLite, CSV, DBF, and in-memory tables with undo/redo edit tracking and Excel/CSV export.

### Software Updates

Automatic update checking and staged installation from GitHub Releases with SemVer 2.0, SHA256 checksum validation, protected settings, transactional rollback, and safe replacement of the updater itself.

## Support

USACE-RMC is committed to maintaining and supporting WPF Framework with regular updates, bug fixes, and enhancements. The framework is under active development and serves as the shared foundation for our suite of desktop engineering applications.

The repository includes extensive unit tests across 13 test projects that also serve as usage examples for the classes and methods in the libraries.

## Applications

WPF Framework powers the following USACE-RMC desktop applications:

- [RMC-BestFit](https://github.com/USACE-RMC/RMC-BestFit) — Bayesian estimation and fitting for flood frequency analysis
- [RMC-RFA](https://github.com/USACE-RMC/RMC-RFA) — Reservoir frequency analysis for flood hazard assessments
- [RMC-TotalRisk](https://github.com/USACE-RMC/RMC-TotalRisk) — Quantitative risk analysis for dam and levee safety
- [LifeSim](https://github.com/USACE-RMC/LifeSim) — Life loss consequence estimation and evacuation simulation

## Related Libraries
